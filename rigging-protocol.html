                  <strong>MINIMUM BREAKING STRENGTH (MBS)</strong> is determined by 3-sigma testing,
                  also known as the three-sigma rule. Three-sigma is a statistical tool used to
                  calculate probability. Minimum break strength is very different from average break
                  strength (abs), although abs is used in the calculation of mbs. The three-sigma
                  value is determined by calculating the standard deviation (a complex and tedious
                  calculation on its own) of a series of five breaks. Then multiply that value by
                  three (hence three-sigma) and finally subtract that product from the average of
                  the entire series. It is 99.73% probable any additional breaks will be at or above
                  this final value.
                </p>
                <p>The three-sigma process:</p>
                <ol>
                  <li>Carry out at least 5 breaks of the item to be rated</li>
                  <li>Calculate the mean</li>
                  <li>Calculate the standard deviation</li>
                  <li>Multiply the standard deviation by 3</li>
                  <li>Subtract the product in step 4 from the mean</li>

              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>FACTOR OF SAFETY</strong> is the ratio between the designated working load
                limit (WLL) or safe working load (SWL) and the load the equipment is expected to
                fail at. Below are examples and different terminologies.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>DESIGN FACTOR (DF)</strong> is specified by a designer or manufacturer and
                this defines the factor applied to the minimum breaking strength (MBS) to determine
                the maximum load acceptable for a component.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>WORKING LOAD LIMIT (WLL)</strong> is a term used by manufacturers to
                indicate the maximum force that should be applied to a component in normal use,
                regardless of industry. The ratio of MBS to WLL is referred to as the DF. Many
                manufacturers specify a df of 4, which implies a WLL of 25% of the mbs.
                Manufacturers state the WLL to ensure the item is not subjected to significant
                fatigue and remains in the range of normal elastic deformation.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>SAFETY FACTOR (SF)</strong> or “factor of safety” is generally defined by
                industry rather than manufacturer. It may be significantly different to a
                manufacturer’s df. For example, a particular connector may have a mbs of 50kn, a
                manufacturer specified a DF of 4, but an industry specified SF of 12 when used for a
                particular application.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>SAFE WORKING LOAD (SWL)</strong> is typically determined by dividing the MBS
                of a component by the SF required for a particular use. As stated above, it’s
                possible that an entertainment rigger may calculate a different SWL for a particular
                use of an item than the value determined by a rescue technician. The SWL should only
                be determined by a competent rigger.
              </li>
            </ol>

              <strong>EXAMPLE:</strong> a particular steel connector has a MBS of 50kn. The
              manufacturer has specified a DF of 4 for this connector, regardless of use. This
              connector has a WLL of 12.5kn and this value should never be exceeded in normal use -
              regardless of industry and application. If this value is exceeded, it should not fail
              below the mbs however it should then be removed from service and destroyed.
            </p>
            <p>
              An entertainment rigger rigging in a certain country is required by the industry
              code-of-practice of that country to use a SF of 10 for flying performers, and thus
              determines the SWL of this connector is (50kn / 10) 5kn.
            </p>
            <p>
              A rescue technician in another country is supposed to apply a SF of 5 to hardware and
              thus determines a swl of (50kn / 5) 10kn for an identical connector.

                Once the ladder is carefully secured against the steel beam, the top rigger is to
                climb the ladder with a protective layer (carpet) and round sling, while the bottom
                rigger secures the ladder.
              </li>
              <li>
                The top rigger sets up a protective layer (carpet) over the beam checking first for
                any potential rough areas or abnormalities - specifically burrs or sharp edges,
                anything that may compromise the hardware. This layer can be taped down if needed.
              </li>
              <li>
                A round sling is then wrapped around the beam by the top rigger over the protective
                layer using a girth hitch. ensure this is secure.
              </li>
              <li>
                The top rigger returns to the floor, collects remaining hardware (delta rapide,
                reeved pulley system) and climbs the ladder with the additional gear, while the
                bottom rigger securs the ladder.
              </li>
              <li>
                The top rigger attaches delta to the round sling then attaches the pulley system to
                the delta. ensure there is no tension on the delta when threading the gate closed
                (remember to thread down).
              </li>
              <li>
                Once all hardware is attached, have a competent rigger double check all the

            <ol>
              <li>
                Once the ladder is carefully secured against the steel beam, the top rigger is to
                climb the ladder with the gravlocks and torque wrench, while the bottom rigger
                secures the ladder.
              </li>
              <li>
                The top rigger attaches gravlock clamp to one side of the flange, threading the bolt
                down to appropriate torque. Match this on the other side with the other gravlock,
                ensuring the openings are opposing and tighten with torque wrench.
              </li>
              <li>
                The top rigger returns to the floor, collects the pipe and runner (nylon sling).
              </li>
              <li>
                Fix the pipe between the two gravlock clamps, ensuring the clamps are lined up and
                the pipe sits flush. Tighten the pipe clamps to appropriate torque.
              </li>
              <li>
                Wrap the runner in a round turn and a choke ensuring the pipe is smooth and is not
                in contact with the gravlock clamps (these are galvanized and the surface can be
                abrasive).
              </li>
              <li>
                The top rigger attaches a connector to the runner then attaches the pulley system to
                the connector.
              </li>
              <li>
                Once all hardware is attached, have a competent rigger double check all the
                attachment points in the load path and attach a green tag.
              </li>
              <li>
                It is the responsibility of the head rigger to ensure the load path is set up
                correctly. This checklist includes - but is not limited to:
                <ul>
                  <li><strong>RUNNER</strong> - check it is evenly wrapped around the pipe</li>
                  <li><strong>CONNECTOR</strong> - ensure the gate is closed properly</li>
                  <li><strong>PULLEY SHEAVES</strong> - ensure these are moving freely</li>
                  <li>
                    <strong>MAINLINE TERMINATION TO THE PULLEY BECKET</strong> - check knot is tied

              <strong>SINGLE USE CORD</strong> - when selecting an appropriate cord for use with
              body suspension, a safety factor of 10 needs to be employed. This safety factor takes
              into account dynamic forces and unknown variables but not terminations. The MBS of the
              cord needs to be derated by 50% to account for knots/terminations.

            <h3>Hardware Selection and Use</h3>
            <p>
              When selecting hardware for suspension, it is important to take into special
              consideration its intended use and how it will work for your application. Certain
              hardware is designed for specific uses. Understand how they are designed and ensure
              their strength is suitable for your specific use. As a general rule of thumb - any
              single connector in the load path should have a MBS of at least 1500 kgs (15kN).
            </p>
            <ol>
              <li>
                <strong>ROUND SLINGS:</strong> Round and synthetic generally - how it is used
                affects the strength so make sure you read the label and derate accordingly.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>CONNECTORS:</strong> Popular connector options are aluminium carabiners,
                steel carabiners, maillon rapides and shackles.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>PULLEYS:</strong> Many pulley systems are available. Marine styles are quite
                popular due to their high strength to weight ratio as well as their durability.
                Aluminium climbing pulleys are also a popular option as they too are lightweight and
                designed specifically with live loads in mind.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>MAINLINE ROPE:</strong> Different applications may require different rope
                types. Commonly used are static or low-stretch ropes made from nylon or polyester.
                Common sizes are 10mm / 11mm / 12mm.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>SWIVELS:</strong> These need to be at least 24 kn - check also the intended
                use of the swivel before purchasing.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>RIG PLATES:</strong> Aluminium climbing plates are most suitable as these
                are rated for human load, are lightweight and are well finished. Custom steel and
                aluminium rigs can also be made to a suitable strength for human load.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>CUSTOM FABRICATION:</strong> This is something that needs very careful
                consideration. All custom fabrication needs to be engineered by a professional who
                understands the intended use of the custom piece, therefore made in such a way to
                withstand the forces imposed on it.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>HOOKS:</strong> Different hooks are available for different uses. The style
                of suspension will determine the desired hook type. Open gape hooks are primarily
                for static/semi-static suspensions; semi-locking hooks for multi directional static
                or dynamic loads; and locking hooks for dynamic loads.

            <ol>
              <li>
                The purpose of the belay (or in the case of body suspension, modified belay) is to
                be able to raise and lower the suspendee in a safe and controlled manner.
              </li>
              <li>
                The belayer should have an attachment point on their person, usually a well fitted
                harness, fit for purpose. Alternatively, utilizing a fixed point may also be
                appropriate (this is usually venue and situation dependent).
              </li>
              <li>
                A suitable descent device should be used. Ensure the rigger/belay is trained in its

            <h3>General Rigging Guidelines</h3>
            <ol>
              <li>All cord is single use and disposable.</li>
              <li>
                Inverted suspensions are to be fitted with a harness with a reusable mainline
                attached or alternatively, a crash mat can be used.
              </li>
              <li>All knots and connections are to be double checked by another rigger.</li>
              <li>
                A visual check of all hardware should be carried out before and after each use.
              </li>
              <li>
                Full hardware inspections are to be carried out and recorded at least every 12
                months.
              </li>
              <li>
                Only approved people are allowed to change, add or remove equipment and/or apparatus
                at our events/workshops. These people may not appoint another person to change,
                adjust or modify any piece of rigging gear unless competent to do so.
              </li>
              <li>
                An approved person may allow a volunteer to clip gear onto the eyelet end of the
                pulleys however you must double check their work.
              </li>
              <li>
                Wherever possible when you have attached anything onto the pulley, get another
                person to double check your work.
              </li>
              <li>
                Only trained riggers may modify, move, adjust any rigging that directly connects to
                the structure.
              </li>
              <li>You must wear a climbing helmet at all times when working at height.</li>
