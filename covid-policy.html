            <ul>
              <li>If you have possible COVID-19 symptoms do not enter the venue.</li>
              <li>If you are unwell or have COVID-19 symptoms, stay at home.</li>
              <li>
                Call Healthline on 0800 358 5453 or contact your general practice if you are
                experiencing any COVID-19 symptoms.
              </li>

            <h3>Good Health, Hygiene and Safety Practices</h3>
            <ul>
              <li>
                Maintain basic hygiene measures, such as frequent hand washing and mask wearing.
              </li>
              <li>
                Sneeze or cough into your elbow and avoid touching your face. This will prevent the
                risk of spreading COVID-19, and other viruses such as the common cold or flu.
              </li>
              <li>Facilities are available so you can regularly wash and dry your hands.</li>
              <li>Hand sanitiser is available throughout the venue.</li>
              <li>
                Masks are provided for all public and volunteers to use indoors and where physical
                distancing from others cannot be maintained.
              </li>
              <li>
                Avoid sharing personal objects. If this is not possible, sanitize hands before and
                after use and clean objects between use as often as possible.

            <h3>Use of Masks and Face Coverings</h3>
            <ul>
              <li>
                Face coverings at our events are always encouraged. Face coverings are a way we can
                protect ourselves and each other.
              </li>
              <li>
                Masks can be removed for meal, refreshment, and comfort breaks, however physical
                distancing should be maintained at these times.
              </li>
              <li>Try not to speak, shout or sing close to others without a mask.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Face Mask Exemptions</h3>
            <ul>
              <li>We encourage volunteers and the public who must wear face coverings to do so.</li>
              <li>
                It’s also important to remember that for some people a face covering is unsuitable
                because of a disability or health condition.
              </li>
              <li>
                Some people will have an exemption card with them to show that there is a reason why
                a face covering is unsuitable for them.
              </li>
              <li>
                Exemption cards are not mandatory, so some people will not have one with them.
              </li>
              <li>
                Be kind and respectful of privacy when approaching someone who isn’t wearing a face
                covering.
              </li>
              <li>
                While it’s not always obvious why a face covering is unsuitable, it’s inappropriate
                to inquire about the nature of a person’s disability or condition.
              </li>
              <li>
                Face coverings are just one of the tools we have for helping to stop the spread of
                COVID-19.
              </li>
              <li>
                When a face covering is unsuitable, it is always important to enable other good
                health, hygiene and safety practices.
