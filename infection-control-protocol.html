                    <ol>
                        <li>Open the bandages and remove them from the package, ensuring the sterile pad is not touched, then hand the bandage to the bio assistant.</li>

                <li>                        
                    The bio assistant is then to:
                    <ol>
                        <li>Without touching the wounds with their gloves, cover the wound with the bandage and apply pressure. </li>
                        <li>Repeat for all wounds.</li>
                        <li>Clean tray and table as defined in the break down section then remove PPE (apron > sleeves > gloves > mask > eyewear) and dispose of single use items in contaminated waste bin. Disinfect eyewear if visibly contaminated.</li>
                    </ol>
                </li>
            </ol>     


            <p>In conditions where numerous wounds need to be dressed, additional assistants may be required.</p>

            <p>It may also be acceptable for an experienced team member to adjust this protocol accordingly, where both roles may be consolidated. </p>
