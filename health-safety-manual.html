            <h4>Overview</h4>
            <p>
              Immersive Environments (<strong>IE</strong>) is committed to providing its workers
              with a healthy and safe work environment. This policy sets out the responsibilities of
              IE and its workers in respect of health and safety in the workplace.
            </p>
            <p>
              IE and its workers will do everything reasonably practicable to ensure we undertake
              facilitating suspensions in a healthy and safe manner.
            </p>
            <p>
              We all play a crucial role in achieving a safe environment. We owe it to ourselves and
              those around us to not expose ourselves to unnecessary risks. We can do so by
              protecting ourselves and others from hazards and hazardous situations, by following
              safe procedures and by adopting safe practices.
            </p>

          <div id="health-safety-policy-purpose">
            <h4>Purpose</h4>
            <p>The purpose of this policy is to:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                Provide a brief summary of New Zealand’s health and safety legislation and define
                accountabilities; and
              </li>
              <li>Comply with the Health and Safety at Work Act 2015 (<strong>HSWA</strong>)</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
              Through the provision of important procedures and guidelines, this health and safety
              policy will help you and others to stay healthy and safe at our events/workshops. Any
              failure to comply with health and safety requirements is taken very seriously by IE
              and may result in expulsion from our events/workshops.

            <h5>DUTIES OF PCBUS</h5>
            <p>
              IE is a PCBU and so must take reasonably practicable steps to ensure the health and

            </ul>
            <h5>DUTIES OF WORKERS</h5>
            <p>Volunteers are ‘workers’ under the HSWA. Accordingly, workers must:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>Take reasonable care for their own safety</li>
              <li>
                Take reasonable care that their actions or omissions do not adversely affect the
                health and safety of other persons

            <p>
              The health and safety of our events and volunteers may be impacted in an emergency,
              for example, in the event of a fire.
            </p>
            <p>
              Whilst IE will take all necessary precautions to prevent an emergency arising, in the
              unlikely event that an emergency does arise, the procedures below are to be followed
              to ensure the health and safety risks associated with such situations are minimised.
            </p>
            <p>
              You must ensure that you are aware of our fire and evacuation procedures and the
              action you should take in the event of such an emergency.
            </p>
          </div>
          <div id="emergency-procedures-first-aid-procedures">
            <h4>Procedures</h4>
            <h5>FIRE</h5>
            <p>If you discover a fire:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>Alert other people in the immediate vicinity to the fire</li>
              <li>Activate any fire alarms and call ‘111’</li>
              <li>
                If safe, try to put out or contain the fire, or otherwise evacuate the premises in
                accordance with emergency evacuation procedures
              </li>
            </ul>
            <p>
              At no time should you risk personal safety in an effort to protect property or others.
            </p>
            <p>In the event of a fire the team leader onsite becomes the fire warden.</p>
            <ul>
              <li>First responsibility is to ensure all people are evacuated</li>
              <li>Second responsibility is to call the fire brigade</li>
            </ul>
            <h5>EMERGENCY EVACUATION</h5>
            <p>If an emergency evacuation is required:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                Follow instructions given to you by emergency services personnel and any designated

              </li>
              <li>Leave the building via the closest designated exit</li>
              <li>Proceed to the designated assembly area</li>
            </ul>
            <p>During an emergency evacuation, you must remain calm and:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>Do not run, crowd exits, or take your belongings with you</li>
              <li>Do not return to the building until it is safe to do so</li>
            </ul>

            <h5>EARTHQUAKE</h5>
            <p>If there is an earthquake, follow these steps:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>Stop, drop and hold onto secure furniture</li>
              <li>Remain clear of windows, glass walls or unsecured furniture</li>
              <li>
                Anyone suspended in the air should remain as they are until the earthquake concludes
              </li>
              <li>
                Following the earthquake do not leave the building until you have been advised by
                the team leader
              </li>
              <li>
                If the fire alarm has been disarmed or you discover a fire, follow the fire
                evacuation process
              </li>
              <li>
                You will be advised by the team leader when it is safe for you to return to the
                venue (if possible)
              </li>
            </ul>
            <h5>FIRST AID</h5>
            <p>You are responsible for:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                Knowing the identity of any first aid officers in the venue and the location of the

            <ol>
              <li>
                We are literally getting under your skin; this intimacy is a lot more comfortable
                for both parties if personal hygiene is looked after. Take a shower, brush your
                teeth and wear clean clothes.
              </li>
              <li>
                We are sharing our time and making an effort to give you this event. If something is

              <li>Be polite to your fellow attendees.</li>
              <li>
                Alcohol and drugs are your own business, but not at our events. We can and will
                refuse to suspend anyone who's under the influence of either.
              </li>
              <li>
                Treat your fellow attendees and crew with respect. Listen to the people in charge.

                photographed. Please notify volunteers if you do not wish your photo to be taken.
              </li>
              <li>
                Inform us of any health conditions (or other possible issues) as this could have
                serious effects on your suspension. We will handle any personal information with due
                discretion.
              </li>
              <li>
                The people involved with suspension have either done this many times before, or are
                doing it for the first time. Some find it easy and some find it very hard. Be
                supportive and lend a hand where it’s needed.
              </li>
              <li>Pay attention to your surroundings and what is going on around you.</li>

              <li>
                There are sharp objects and contaminated equipment around. Pay attention to what
                might be near you. If you are not a volunteer, or, you are a volunteer but do not
                have a specific role, <strong>do not touch anything</strong> unless you are directed
                to do so. If in doubt, ask someone. Don't touch anything with blood on it, not even
                your own blood.

            <h4>Overview</h4>
            <p>
              IE is committed to preventing violence and making our events a safe and inclusive
              place to volunteer, learn, and network. We do not tolerate behavior that is violent,
              threatening, intimidating, harassing, bullying, or coercive towards anyone.
            </p>
            <p>
              Bullying, harassment and/or discrimination in the workplace is unlawful in accordance
              with the employment relations act 2000, the Health and Safety at Work act 2015, the
              Human Rights Act 1993 and the Harassment Act 1997.

            <p>
              We do not permit any act of harassment, including harassment or discrimination that is
              based, in fact or perception, on an individual's sex, race, ethnicity, religion,
              national origin, disability, age, sexual orientation, or gender identification, as
              well as any other legally protected characteristics.

            <h4>Purpose</h4>
            <p>
              This policy is intended to create and maintain a safe environment for everyone, and to
              encourage and enable anyone to raise legitimate concerns within the group prior to
              seeking resolution outside the organization. Consent is everything - we have a

              disciplinary action, including expulsion from current events, suspension from future
              events, and/or suspension of any volunteer position. In addition to potential negative
              consequences for individuals, discrimination may result in violations of laws which

            <h4>Definitions</h4>
            <h6>BULLYING</h6>
            <p>
              Worksafe New Zealand defines workplace bullying as repeated and unreasonable behaviour
              directed towards a worker or a group of workers that creates a risk to health and
              safety.
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                Repeated behaviour is persistent and can involve a range of actions over time; and
              </li>
              <li>
                Unreasonable behaviour means actions that a reasonable person in the same
                circumstances would see as unreasonable. It includes victimising, humiliating,
                intimidating or threatening a person.
              </li>
            </ul>
            <p>
              A single incident of unreasonable behaviour is not considered workplace bullying, but
              it could escalate and should not be ignored.
            </p>

            <p>
              Workplace bullying can be carried out in a variety of ways including through email,
              text messaging, internet chat rooms or other social media channels. In some cases
              workplace bullying may occur outside normal working hours. The policy applies to
              behaviours exhibited at work and at any work-related functions.
            </p>

            <p>
              Workplace bullying can be directed at a single worker or group of workers and can be
              carried out by one or more workers. It can also be directed at or perpetrated by other
              people such as clients, customers and members of the public.
            </p>

            <h6>BULLYING IS NOT:</h6>
            <ul>
              <li>One-off or occasional instances of forgetfulness, rudeness or tactlessness;</li>
              <li>Setting high performance standards because of quality or safety;</li>
              <li>Constructive feedback and legitimate advice or peer review;</li>
              <li>
                A manager requiring reasonable verbal or written work instructions to be carried
                out;
              </li>
              <li>
                Warning or disciplining employees in line with the workplace’s code of conduct; and
              </li>
              <li>A single incident of unreasonable behaviour (but it could escalate)</li>
            </ul>
            <h6>DISCRIMINATION</h6>
            <p>
              Discrimination is behaviour that excludes or restricts a person or group from
              opportunities that are available to others. The behaviour primarily is seen as unfair,
              along with the potential to cause harm, humiliation, offence or intimidation.
            </p>
            <p>
              Discrimination covered in the Human Rights Act 1993 includes sex (including pregnancy
              and childbirth), marital status, religious belief, ethical belief, colour, race,
              ethnic or national origins including citizenship, disability of any kind, age, gender,
              political opinion, employment status, family status or sexual orientation.
            </p>

            <h6>HARASSMENT</h6>
            <p>
              Under the Harassment Act 1997, harassment takes place when someone directs one or more
              specified acts at another person (including watching, loitering, following, accosting,
              interfering with another person’s property or acting in ways that causes the person to
              fear for their safety) at least twice in a 12 month period.
            </p>
            <p>
              Harassment has the potential to cause humiliation, offence or intimidation. It is
              usually repeated behaviour but even one instance may cause reasonable concern.
            </p>
            <p>
              The Harassment Act 1997 considers certain serious types of harassment as criminal
              offences, and allows the person being harassed to obtain trespass orders or
              restraining orders against the offender. It puts in place sanctions for breaches.
            </p>

            <h6>SEXUAL HARASSMENT</h6>
            <p>The Human Rights Act 1993 defines sexual harassment as:</p>
            <p>
              <span class="emphasized"
                >“Any unwelcome or offensive sexual behaviour that is repeated, or is serious enough
                to have a harmful effect, or which contains an implied or overt promise of
                preferential treatment or an implied or overt threat of detrimental treatment”</span
              >
            </p>

            <p>
              Be mindful that words and behaviour that seem innocent can take on a sexual nature,
              depending on the context.
            </p>

            <p>Examples of sexual harassment include:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>Offensive sexual remarks or jokes</li>
              <li>Unwelcome comments about looks and dress</li>
              <li>Unwelcome touching (back, arm, shoulder or hugging)</li>
              <li>Wolf whistles</li>
              <li>Sending inappropriate text messages</li>
              <li>Sending sexually offensive images</li>
              <li>Regular hassling for a date</li>
              <li>Being followed</li>
              <li>Intrusive questions about sex life</li>
              <li>Staring or leering</li>
            </ul>
          </div>
          <div id="bullying-harassment-policy-what-to-do">
            <h4>What Should You Do?</h4>
            <h6>HANDLING GENERAL DISPUTES:</h6>
            <p>
              If you are having a dispute with another attendee, we encourage you to talk it over
              with the team leader or a volunteer. We want to help you work out problems before they
              become more serious and possibly violent. You will not be disciplined for bringing
              these types of problems to our attention or for reporting a suspected violation, as
              long as this is done in good faith.
            </p>

            <h6>REPORTING ACTS OF HARASSMENT, DISCRIMINATION OR CONSENT VIOLATIONS:</h6>
            <p>
              If you experience or witness behaviours against any individual that you think might
              constitute discrimination, intimidation, harassment, or consent violation -
              immediately notify the team leader.
            </p>

            <p>
              If your report is regarding one or more of the team leaders, then you can communicate
              this with Fleur Kelsey in person or at <strong>fleurkelsey@yahoo.com.au</strong>.
            </p>

            <h6>REPORTING ACTS OR THREATS OF VIOLENCE:</h6>

            <p>
              You should immediately report any act of physical or sexual violence or threat of
              violence. This report should be made to the police. You should also immediately report
              any suspicious person or activities to the team leader.
            </p>

            <p>Do not place yourself in danger.</p>

            <p>
              We will promptly and thoroughly investigate all reports of discrimination and
              harassment that are event related incidents. We will protect the identity of a person
              who makes a report to the extent possible.
            </p>

            <p>
              You will not be disciplined for asking questions about discrimination or harassment,
              for bringing these types of problems to our attention, or for reporting a suspected
              violation – as long as it is in good faith. Retaliation in response to reporting or
              opposing discrimination, or in response to participating in the investigation of a
              complaint of discrimination, is itself unlawful discrimination.

            <h4>Introduction</h4>
            <p>
              IE is committed to providing an environment that ensures the wellbeing and safety of
              it’s volunteers. We have a clear duty under the Health and Safety in at Work Act 2015
              to identify and manage hazards. There can be no doubt that the presence of illicit
              substances or alcohol within the body above the relevant screening cut-off
              concentrations represents a hazard to the safety of the individual and others within
              our events.
            </p>

            <p>
              The overall objective of this policy is to provide for a drug and alcohol free work
              environment and through doing so to ensure that volunteers are not impaired in their
              ability to perform their roles in a safe, productive and healthy manner, which in turn
              will reduce/prevent accidents and injuries at our events.
            </p>

            <p>
              The use of drugs (both illicit and prescription) and other substances such as alcohol
              can affect a person's coordination, concentration, dexterity, and general ability to
              carry out their duties. The use of drugs and alcohol at our events can put other
              people's safety at risk.

            <h4>Serious Misconduct</h4>
            <p>
              Drug and alcohol use will be regarded as serious misconduct when it affects a
              volunteers performance.
            </p>

            <p>Other types of behaviour will be considered serious misconduct, including:</p>

              <li>Being under the influence of drugs or alcohol while at our events.</li>
              <li>
                Unauthorised consumption of alcohol or drugs (except where under the instruction of
                a physician and there is no potential for adverse effects) during event hours and
                immediately prior to our event, or during rest breaks.
              </li>
            </ul>
            <p>
              Where, after a full and fair inquiry, serious misconduct is found to have occurred,
              appropriate disciplinary action will be taken which may include expulsion from our
              event and subsequent events.
